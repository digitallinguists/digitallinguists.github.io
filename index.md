# Digital Linguists

The project Digital Linguists collects code and documentation that is used in linguistic research. We focus on historical linguistics, language typology and language documentation. We publish everything Github under the Apache License 2.0.

The following Github repositories a currently maintained at Digital Linguists:

* [CMDI-Maker](cmdi-maker/index.html): A tool for linguists for easily creating IMDI and CMDI metadata to upload to a LAT language archive.
* [Linguistic JavaScript](linguistic-javascript/index.html): A collection of JavaScript code and documentation for data management and analysis in linguistic research.
* [Scripts](/scripts/index.html): A collection of helper scripts in various programming languages, collected from research projects.

If you have any source code or documentation that you want us to include in our collection please write a mail to [Peter Bouda (pbouda@cidles.eu)](mailto:pbouda@cidles.eu).
